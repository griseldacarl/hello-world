This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow. 
This is an excellent overview of GitHub. While I am familiar with the basics of GitHub, I haven't done much with creating branches. So far, in this tutorial, I have created a new respository called 'hello-world'. I have recognized the 'main' branch and created the 'readme-edits' branch. Of course, I have found the README.md file, and the following edits are the result. Looking at the rest of the tutorial, I will learn about 'pull request' and 'merge your pull request'.
